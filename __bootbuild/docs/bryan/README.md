## Organization Note

These files are kept separate from the bootstrap system documentation since they:
1. Are personal/project-specific (not part of bootstrap standards)
2. Don't apply to all projects using the bootstrap system
3. Serve as reference/historical documentation

If you're looking for bootstrap system documentation, see the parent directory.
